### Tags

HTML is based on XML, a data language, so the way you use HTML is by writing different tags that describe what you want show on a screen

Tags are hidden keywords that tell HTML what an element is. They show what feature needs to be implemented. Different tags mean different results.

There are many different tags that you can use in HTML!

##### Example Tag

```html
<h1>Hello HTML Heading</h1>

```
###### This creates a header tag on the page that states, "Hello HTML Heading"


#### Important! *Every HTML tag must have a starting and closing tag. This is the ensure that browser knows where different elements start and end. An ending tag is the same as the starting, but it starts with a "/" added at the end.*


### The Most Basic HTML Entity: Text
When you are writing a website, most of your content will be in plain text. HTML gives you many different ways to deal with text, but the two most useful ways is heading and paragaphs.

The heading tags are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5 and H6. H1 is the biggest and it decreases size as you increase the number.

However, the syntax remains the same:
```html
<h1>H1 - Biggest</h1>
<h1>H2</h1>
<h1>H3</h1>
<h1>H4</h1>
<h1>H5</h1>
<h1>H6 - Smallest</h1>

```

Headers are always slightly bolded, like the title on an essay or an article you are reading. However, if you want to write normal text, you have to go to the paragraph tag. It looks like this:

```html
<p>THis is my first paragraph!</p>
```
